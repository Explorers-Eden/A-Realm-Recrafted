### Changes:
- Changed item which is used to add/change Waypoint Lore to Book (was Paper)
- Waypoint Menus no longer show the current Waypoint in the list

    - Text keys to grant permission `trust <playername>` or `Trust <playername>`
    - Text keys to revoke permission `untrust <playername>` or `Untrust <playername>`
